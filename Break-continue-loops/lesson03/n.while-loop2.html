        REVIEW: isNaN()
        we can use isNaN():
        - isNaN(numeric) ==> returns false
        - isNaN(not numeric) ==> returns true

        Example:
        isNaN(5) ==> False because 5 is numeric value
        isNaN(xyz) ==> True because xyz is not numeric value

        We had to use while loop instead of for loop because we don't know how many times we will ask the user
        for loop, we have to specify the maximum limit to ask the user

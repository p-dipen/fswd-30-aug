        // Quick review about if condition:
        /*
        Problem:
        We will ask the user to input an integer number (whole number),
        then we can output one of the following messages:
        - Your number is even (if it's even number)
        - Your number is odd (if it's odd number)
        if the user type a text they should see a warning message
        */

        /*
      Math Hint:
      - even numbers have the value of 0 as remainder when dividing them by 2
      - odd numbers have different remainder value other than 0

      JS Example:
      4/2 = 2.0 ==> 4 is even number without any decimal points (remainder = 0)
      5/2 = 2.5 ==> 5 is odd number with decimal pints (remainder = 1 in JS)

      The logic here, we need to know the value of the division remainder
      if (the division remainder is 0) => this number is "Even"
      else => this number is "Odd"

      We know we have this symbol "/" to give the full result of division

      Good News! In JavaScript we can use this symbol "%" named "modulo operator"
      The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of division operation.

      Conclusion:
      The result of using % is either 0 (for even number) or 1 (for odd number)
      */

        var num = parseInt(prompt("Please enter your integer number"));

        // let's try to test the %
        // console.log(num % 2);

        // we have a function named isNaN()
        // it returns "true" if the value is not number 
        // it returns "false" if the value is number


        // at the very beginning let's check the user input is number or not
        // Using the JS built-in function isNaN()

        if (isNaN(num)) {
            document.write("Invalid Input!");
        } else if (num % 2 == 0) {
            document.write("Your number is even");
        } else {
            document.write("Your number is odd");
        }

        document.write("<hr>");

        // Other solution:
        if (num % 2 == 0) {
            document.write("Your number is even");
        } else if (num % 2 == 1) {
            document.write("Your number is odd");
        } else {
            document.write("Invalid Input!");
        }

        /*
      Problem:
      - The user bought x number of items
      - they need to know the total price for these items and also print the item price list

      Required Steps:
      1- Ask the user to input how many items did they buy?
         and save it into a variable

      2- We need to loop for x of times based on the number of items they bought

      3- In each loop iteration:
        a. we ask the user to enter the price of the current item
        b. Each price value has to be saved into an "array"
        (So we need to declare an empty array before the loop starts)
        c. Adding the prices to a variable "total"

      4- Output (print) the arrays that contains the prices

      5- Output the total value of adding all the items' prices
      */

        // 1) Getting the number of items:  
        var itemsNum = parseInt(prompt("How many items did you buy?")); // 4 items ==> items = 4;

        // so if the user input 4, we need to loop 4 times
        // if user input any number, we need to loop x of times based on that number
        // we need to loop for 4 times to ask the user to enter the prices of their four items:

        // How can we save the price values for all these x items
        // It's almost impossible to create a varaible for each item price 
        // Solution: We can use array to save all price values for all the items

        // declare an empty array:
        var itemPriceList = []; // var itemPriceList = new Array();
        /*
            We will use this empty array (for now) "itemPriceList" to save the price of each item that the user is going to enter, Why? 
            because at the end of the program it's very good and nice idea to print price list of all the items to the user with the total value.
        */


        var priceTotal = 0; // the container with initial value of 0 for the total formula

        // We need a for loop to repeat the question 4 times:

        /*
        Notice that below we put counter=0 because this will the first index of itemPriceList array
        and since arrays is 0 based index so we should start with 0

        if you have no intention to use the loop counter to be the index of your arrays,
        Yes, in such case you can start with 1 or any other value
        */
        for (var counter = 0; counter < itemsNum; counter++) {

                Saving each price item into the array "itemPriceList"
                If we have 3 items:
                price of item1 has to be saved in the index 0 of the array
                price of item2 has to be saved in the index 1 of the array		
                price of item3 has to be saved in the index 2 of the array
            */

            // if the input is: 55.17 = prompt => "55.17" => parseFloat => 55.17;

            // The other solution:
            // Or using the push() array method to insert the price of the current item
            // itemPriceList.push(parseFloat(prompt("Enter the price of this item")));

            // long way:
            // priceTotal = priceTotal + itemPriceList[counter];

            // or use the short way:
            priceTotal += itemPriceList[counter];
        }

        // 2) Printing the list of prices:
        /*
        To make sure that the array itemPriceList contains all the item prices that the user entered,
        we need to output all the array values.
        Which means that we need to output:
        the array value of index 0
        the array value of index 1
        the array value of index 2
        the array value of index 3
        the array value of index x (depending on how many items we have)
        */

        // below will output value1, value2, value3, ....
        document.write(itemPriceList); // 20,60,34

        // if you want to display it vertically, refer to "JS05: for-array.html"
        // remember that itemPriceList is an array, so print its items (elements)
        // we need to use for loop, just create a new for loop:
        /*
        for example:
        3 items prices: 89, 90, 56
        in the array:
        index 0 ==> 89
        index 1 ==> 90
        index 2 ==> 56
        to print beyond index 2, we wil get "undefined"
        index 3 ==> undefined		
        */

            document.write(itemPriceList[i] + "<br>");
        }

        // NOTE: don't forget to place the output message for the total after the loop (not inside the loop)
        document.write("Total is: " + priceTotal);

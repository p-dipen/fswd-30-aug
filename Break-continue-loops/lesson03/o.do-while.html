                 3  Types of loops:
                 - for loop
                 - while loop
                 - do while loop
     
                 Note: Please don't forget that most loops have:
                 1. a loop variable which is the counter to count how many times the loop must run
                 2. 3 parts (section) regarding the loop counter variable:
                     - the initial value to start with
                     - the condition to keep the loop running
                     - *the increment/decrement operator (change the loop counter value) => for loop
      */

        var myIndex;
        for (myIndex = 1; myIndex <= 25; myIndex++) {

        document.write("<hr>");

        /* print: 1 - 20 with while loop */
        var value1 = 1; /* the loop counter initial value is 1 */
        /* in between the bracket is the condition */
        while (value1 <= 25) {
            document.write("<p>" + value1 + "</p>");
            value1++; /* either increment or decrement the loop counter */

      Summary:
      
      While loop:
      // we check first before starting the loop
      while (condition) { 
          // this code here will NEVER run IF the condition is FALSE!
      }

      Do While loop:
      // we check after the loop block
      do {
          // this code will run AT LEAST one time EVEN IF the condition is FALSE
      } while (condition)
      */

        // best example of using do while like our game for guessing the lucky number:
        var secretNumber = 3;
        var userNumber;
        // the do while loop code will run at least one time
        // even if the condition is false
        do {
            userNumber = prompt("Try to guess the secret number between 1 and 5");
            // we do need to check after getting the answer from the user
        } while (userNumber != secretNumber);

        if (6 === "6") ==> False

        if (6 != "6") ==> False
        if (6 !== "6") ==> True

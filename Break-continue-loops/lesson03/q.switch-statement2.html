        //  ask the user to input his MS-Office Current Module:
        var officeModule = prompt("What's your current MS Office module (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, or Outlook)?");

        /*
        The logic:
        Using Switch statement:

        in case if the module is "Word" or "WORD" or "word" 
        and look here we need to make it open to any case or working with any case
        then write "MS Word is 2 weeks"

        in case if the module is "Excel"
        then write "MS Excel is 2 weeks"

        in case if the module is "PowerPoint"
        then write "MS PowerPoint is 1 week"

        in case if the module is "Outlook"
        then write "MS Outlook is 1 week"

        otherwise, write "Sorry this module is not part of the curriculum!"

        you will use document.write()

        Now we need to find a solution:
        To ignore the lower case or upper case or mixing case, 
    	
        Remember that JavaScript is built on objects, anything in JavaScript is an "object"

        >> objectName.property
        >> objectName.method()

        we had to work with array object and we used 
        the length property that belong to that object

        Now here we are dealing with a string object (text value), the string object has two methods

        We will just use one of the two built-in JavaScript functions/methods of the string object:
    	
        - toUpperCase() ==> to convert the current text to UPPER CASE
        - toLowerCase() ==> to convert the current text to lower case

        so we need to attach one of these method to the end of the text variable in order to change its case.
    	
        To attach one of these two functions to a variable of type text
        we need to use the "object.method()" syntax

        officeModule variable is a "string"
        because anything in JS is an object
        so "string" is an object
        which means it has properties and methods
        */

        // do you want to use WORD or word
        // we will use the lower case to check the module's names
        // if the user put (officeModule variable): "WORD" or "word" or "Word" or "WoRd", or "wOrD", "worD", etc...
        // all these inputs have to be changed to "word" with lowercase
        // so at the end the value of officeModule will be "word"

        /*
            Below our object name is "officeModule"
            and this officeModule object is of type "string object"
            and string object has the following two methods
            - toUpperCase() ==> to convert the current text to UPPER CASE
            - toLowerCase() ==> to convert the current text to lower case
    
            because they are methods we need to add ( and ) at the end
        */
        switch (officeModule.toLowerCase()) {
            case "word": // we are checking if the value is "word" all in small letter
                document.write("MS Word is 2-week module");
                break;

            case "excel": // we are checking if the value is "excel" all in small letter
                document.write("MS Excel is 2-week module");
                break;

            case "powerpoint": // we are checking if the value is "powerpoint" all in small letter
                document.write("MS PowerPoint is 1-week module");
                break;

            case "outlook": // we are checking if the value is "outlook" all in small letter
                document.write("MS Outlook is 1-week module");
                break;
            default:
                document.write("Sorry, this module is not part of the curriculum!");

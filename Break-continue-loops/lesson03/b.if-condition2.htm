        /*
            In JavaScript, we have the following 3 keywords and are called: "Logical Operator"
            - AND ==> &&
            - OR ==> ||
            - NOT ==> !
        */

        /*
           With the logical operators we need to use following
           table. This table is called "Truth Table"
       	
           OR Formula (OR Truth Table): 
           LEFT-HAND SIDE OR RIGHT-HAND-SIDE ==> BOOLEAN RESULT
           TRUE OR TRUE ==> TRUE 
           TRUE OR FALSE ==> TRUE
           FALSE OR TRUE ==> TRUE
           FALSE OR FALSE ==> FALSE <== All FALSE = FALSE (The key)
                	
           AND Formula (And Truth Table):
           LEFT-HAND SIDE AND RIGHT-HAND-SIDE ==> BOOLEAN RESULT
           TRUE AND TRUE ==> TRUE <== All TRUE = TRUE (The key)
           TRUE AND FALSE ==> FALSE
           FALSE AND TRUE ==> FALSE
           FALSE AND FALSE ==> FALSE 
       	
           NOT:
           NOT TRUE (!TRUE) ==> FALSE
           NOT FALSE (!FALSE) ==> TRUE

           Simple Trick:
           Assume that:
           TRUE = 1
           FALSE = 0
           Remember that there is no "2", the maximum value is 1
           OR = +
           AND = *
           
           Examples:
           TRUE OR TRUE ==> TRUE 
           like saying: 1 + 1 = 1

           TRUE OR FALSE ==> TRUE
           like saying: 1 + 0 = 1

           TRUE AND TRUE ==> TRUE 
           like saying: 1 * 1 = 1


           TRUE AND FALSE ==> FALSE
           like saying: 1 * 0 = 0
       */

        /*
        Example of using OR in our real life:
        if (lives in GTA OR works in GTA OR Studies in GTA) {

        }

        if (FALSE OR TRUE OR FALSE) {

        - condition2: avg 90+

        if condition1 AND condition2 are TRUE ==> you can apply for any MD college

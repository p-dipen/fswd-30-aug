           We have if condition in our life:
           if (it's raining) then I will take my umbrella
           else (otherwise) I will wear my sun-glasses
           
           In JS:
           if condition syntax:
           if (our condition) {
               // our code if the condition is true
           } else {
               // our code if the condition is false
           }
           
           with if condition we can use the following operator symbols:      
           Comparison Operators: 
           == equal to (notice it's either == or === but NOT =)
           === exactly equal to (with type and value)! We will cover it later
           != not equal to
           > greater than
           < less than
           >= greater than or equal to
           <= less than or equal to 
           */

        // we need to check if the average value is greater than or equal to 60
        if (average >= 60) {
            // the code in between the { and } belongs to if condition
            // this code will be ONLY executed or run when the condition is true
            // which means it will run only when the average is greater/or equal to 60
            document.write("<p>Your average is: " + average + ", good Job, you passed!</p>");

            // so if the condition is false, 
            // JS will ignore all the code inside this "if block" 
            // and just jump to the next line of code after the "if condition"
        } else {
            // The else block will ONLY be executed when the first part of if condition is false
            document.write("<p>Don't worry, you still have another chance</p>");
        }

        // no need to create another if statement (Bad coding example)

        // we can combine two or more variables with single var keyword using commas

        var value1 = prompt("Please enter your first numeric value:");

        // since prompt method returns a string
        // we need to convert the input value into a number
        // to do that we can use:
        // parseInt() or parseFloat()
        value1 = parseFloat(value1);

        // or using this way by nesting two functions (methods) together
        var value2 = parseFloat(prompt("Please enter your second numeric value:"));

        // Problem: to find the maximum value or if both are equal:
        /*
           if the user inputs:
           - 90
           - 80
           to say: The maximum value is: 90

           if the user inputs:
           - 70
           - 98

           Solution (Logic):
           
            To solve this problem we will use:
            if
            else if
            else

            Notice that with multiple results (options)
            We need to include else if
            In the example below we have 3 probabilities
            1: we might have the first value greater than the second one
            2: we might have the second value greater than the first one
            3: we might have both values the same

            So any if condition check that goes beyond two results (probabilities)
            we need to use else if

        /*
        Note:
        We used the example above to demonstrate if, elseif, and else blocks
        JavaScript has a built-in function (method) that belongs to the "Math" object:
        Math.max(value1, value2, valueN);
        Math.max(value1,value2)
        The function returns the maximum number
        Also there is Math.min() for the minimum number

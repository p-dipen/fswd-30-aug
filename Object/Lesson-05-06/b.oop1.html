        /*
            Review:
            We used some methods of the built-in objects in JS (Object Dot Notation):
            - the log() method of the console object:
              console.log("Hello World!");
            - the write() method of the document object:
              document.write("<h1>Heading 1</h1>");
    
            We used some properties of the built-in objects in JS:
            - the title property of the document object:
            - document.title => will give us the document title
    
            to access our object members (properties and methods) using the dot notation:
            - myObjectName.property
            - myObjectName.method()
    
            
            Creating Our Custom Objects:
            ----------------------------
            The syntax (template) to create our own/custom object:
            let/var objectName = {
                property1Name: property1Value,
                property2Name: property2Value,
                property3Name: property3Value,
            };
        */


        // adding the owner of the car, name, year:
        // using array might not be clear!
        let carInfoArr = ['Martin', '2017', 4, 'white', 30000];

        // for learning demo, we will use the name carObj
        // literal notation
        // creating our "carObj" object:
        let carObj = {
            /*
            object is based on keys and values:

            Notice that each key-value pair is separated by a comma.

            in this example:
            the key "owner" has the value of "Martin"
            the key "year" has the value of 2017

            The last key-value pair can have a trailing or hanging comma, but itâ€™s not necessary (optional).

            A value can be of any data type: boolean, function, string, integer and even other objects.

             key: value => owner: "Martin" (inside the object)
             var = value => let owner = "Martin"

            */

            // Notice that this object contains "properties" only (no methods/function)
            owner: "Martin",  // if the property value is string, we have to enclose it with ' or "

            // no need for comma for the last item/property

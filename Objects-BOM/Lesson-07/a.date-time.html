        /*
            Don't forget that anything in JS is an object :-)
            We have the "Date" object:

            Like any object, Date object has properties and methods()

            Properties and Methods of the "Date" object:

            The following methods for retrieving date values from Date object
            - getDate()
            - getDay()
            - getMonth()
            - getFullYear()

            Based on what we have learned before:
            we have the string and array object
            we can create them using the new keyword:

            Example:
            var myArray = new Array() => this will create an empty array
            var myString = new String() => this will create an empty string

            We can do/use the same sentence to create a new date object!

        // First step is to create a new variable and assign to it a date object
        /*
        This will create a new Date object and initialize it to the current date and time
        based on the client computer's clock:
        */
        var currentDate = new Date(); // return the full date and time together!

        // testing:
        console.log(currentDate); // Thu Aug 12 2021 10:26:14 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)

        // Task: getting only the date:
        // remember that teh variable "currentDate" is a Date object
        // which means currentDate has all the properties and methods of Date object
        console.log(currentDate.getDate()); // 12 today is 12th of August (the date of today)

        // The months are 0 based index
        // First month => "Jan" has the index of 0
        // Second month => "Feb" has the index of 1
        // The following code will display the index of the current file
        // getMonth() => Get the month as a number (0-11)
        console.log(currentDate.getMonth()); // 7

        /*
        1 => for Sunday
        2 => for Monday
        and so on...
        */
        console.log(currentDate.getDay()); // 4 for Thursday

        console.log(currentDate.getFullYear()); // 2021

        // you can check W3schools: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_date_methods.asp

        /*
        Besides getting the Date value(s), we can also set these values:

        The following methods for setting date values of an existing Date object
                - setDate()
                - setMonth()
                - setFullYear()

        /*
        World Time:
        The concept of now means the same point in time everywhere in the world.
        This can be done using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC),
        which is an international basis of civil and scientific time and was implemented in 1964.
        It was previously known as GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) so 0:00 UTC is also a midnight in Greenwich, London.

        JavaScript supports UTC with these methods:
        - toUTCString() and toLocalString()

        Both methods are used to return the date and time stored in the Date object as a "string"
        based on either:
        - UTC Format => toUTCString()
        - or Local Time Format => toLocalString()
        */

        // First step is create a new variable and assign to it a date object:
        // let's name it "localTime"
        /*
        This will create a new Date object and initialize it to the current date and time
        based on the client computer's clock (as we saw in the first example):
        */
        var localTime = new Date();
        /*
        Note: Date object stores the number of milliseconds
        between the date and time on your computer's clock
        and midnight UTC on January 1, 1970)
        */

        // Store the string returned by the toUTCString() method in the "html" variable:
        var html = "<p>The current time is: " + localTime + "</p>";
        document.write(html);
        // Output: The current time is: Thu Aug 12 2021 11:11:18 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)

        // don't forget that we can use the + for concatenating strings:
        // Below we are NOT overriding the content/value of "html" variable:
        html += "<p>Here is my next text just for testing!</p>";
        // document.write(html);

        To find the difference in minutes between the current local's time and UTC,

        - If time zone is ahead of UTC (like in Australia) ==> return a negative number
        */
